## We chose this model because the Multiple R-squared is closer to 1 than in the other models.
## Estimate shows the relationship between x and y, for an x value x1 we can perdict the y value to be 48.6 + (x1*0.0012)
## the P-value is 0.89 which means there is a 89% chance that height is not meaningful for the regression.
## the t value of 0.138 suggests that the relationship is positive and not significant
